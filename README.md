42RomaLUISS-Libft

This repository was created for the purpose of completing the project "libft", assigned as a task at school-42 at the beginning of the year 2023. The score assigned to me by the moulinette application of the Roman section (Italy) of school-42 was: 116%. The above application detected an error in the function "ft_substr", which was related to the control that my implementation performed on incoming strings.
In the version delivered to the moulinette application, the "ft_substr" function returned a pointer to NULL even if the source string was simply empty. In the version you currently find in this repository the error has been corrected, but I have not yet checked if the 42-school moulinette program considers this correction valid.
The rest of the project passed all tests related to memory protection and algorithm consistency.
Although the tasks assigned by the school may be similar as time changes, the fact remains that they are periodically changed: therefore, if this implementation was valid at the beginning of 2023, it will not necessarily be valid from now on.
To future students who want to take advantage of my implementation I recommend the following uses.
Use my features to get a general idea of what your goals might be, but try to develop your own version of the features. My repository will not be useful to you otherwise.
Keep in your static memory the observation that the validity of my functions remains totally hypothetical: another version of the project may require totally different functions.
If you want to use an updated version of the library, refer to the "fporcielibft" repository.
